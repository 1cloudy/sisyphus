Imagine you're filling a complex form on site, or typing effervescent and extensive
comment. And when you're almost done with that browser is crashed, or you closed tab 
mistakenly, or electricity is turned off, or something else break your efforts. 
Disgusting, huh?

With **Sisyphus** on site you just reopen page in your modern (with HTML 5 support) browser
and see all your changes at that forms. It's lightweight (1Kb) jQuery plugin uses Local 
Storage to prevent your work be lost. And Sisyphus is easy to use and needs you just to 
select forms to protect:

$('#form1, #specialForm').sisyphus();

Local Storage will be freed of these forms values on submit or reset.
That's it!
